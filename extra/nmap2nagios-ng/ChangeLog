0.06p1	11/02/2000 - TAG
	- Woo! Lots of changes.  Now generates a Netsaint 
	  v0.0.6 output (includes volatile value in service entry)
	  Includes nmap's OS Guess as comment above host 
	  entry to aid in future identification
	  Auto-assigns hosts to hostgroups based on matching 
	  nmap's OS Guess.  
	  Generates a service entry for every detected port 
	  instead of just known services (Thanks SPC Foreman)
	  Insures unique service entries when nmap outputs 
	  name service name for multiple ports on a host
	  by appending port number to subsequent entries.

	- Weeee! Total rewrite! Ok let's see what did I just do?
	- Removed parsing of nmap's standard output in favor of
	  the XML log.  Must easier to work with!
	- Removed all hard-coded configuration settings and moved 
	  to XML-based configuration file.
	- Made hostgroup matches dynamic so any host field (name, 
	  address, osmatch, etc) can be used to add a host to a group.
	- Moved all the output formatting to the configuration 
	  file to allow for much more flexiability.
